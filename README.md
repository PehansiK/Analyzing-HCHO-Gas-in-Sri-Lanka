# Analyzing-HCHO-Gas-in-Sri-Lanka

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of formaldehyde (HCHO) levels in Sri Lankan cities using data from the Sentinel-5P satellite. The goal is to understand spatial and temporal patterns of HCHO, assess air quality, identify sources of emissions, and develop prediction algorithms.

## Objectives

- Utilize data engineering skills to analyze HCHO data in Sri Lanka.
- Understand the importance of HCHO monitoring for air quality and climate studies.
- Develop insights into potential HCHO sources and spatial/temporal trends.
- Develop time series prediction algorithms (ML or otherwise).

## Data Description

- HCHO Dataset: Daily HCHO measurements (tropospheric HCHO column number density in mol/mÂ²) from 2019/1/1 to 2023/12/31 for seven cities in Sri Lanka.
- Cities: 'Colombo Proper', 'Deniyaya, Matara', 'Nuwara Eliya Proper', 'Bibile, Monaragala', 'Kurunegala Proper', 'Jaffna Proper', and 'Kandy Proper'.

- Sri Lanka Weather Dataset : Comprehensive Weather Data for 30 Prominent Cities in Sri Lanka: 2010-2023 (Kaggle)
- Population Dataset : Mid-year Population Estimates by District & Sex, 2014 - 2023 (Department of Census and Statistics, Sri Lanka)
- Area Dataset : Area of Sri Lanka by Province and District (Department of Census and Statistics, Sri Lanka)

## Tasks

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and prepare the data: Address missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.
   - Explore descriptive statistics: Summarize HCHO levels for each city and across the entire dataset.
   - Visualize data distribution: Create histograms, boxplots, or other visualizations.

2. **Spatio-Temporal Analysis**
   - Analyze trends over time: Identify seasonal variations, long-term changes, and compare trends across cities. Investigate changes due to COVID-19 lockdowns.
   - Correlate HCHO levels with external factors: Explore correlations with weather, fire events, or anthropogenic activities.
   - Compare spatial patterns: Investigate differences between cities and potential contributing factors.

3. **Machine Learning**
   - Develop a machine learning model (e.g., ARIMA) to predict future HCHO levels based on historical data and external factors.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Deliverables

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- Analysis of trends, correlations, and spatial patterns.
- Machine learning model for HCHO prediction and evaluation results.

## Conclusion

This project aims to contribute to environmental and public health research by analyzing HCHO data and developing prediction algorithms. By understanding HCHO levels and their impacts, we can better address air quality issues and promote sustainable development practices in Sri Lanka.
